        Pitch Card for a proposed game
      </h2>
      <p class="project3-paragraph">
        I created a game design document for a rogue-like dungeon crawler mobile
        game. The document includes the design of a core loop, win/lose
        conditions, game mechanics, level progression, and stats improvement.
        The following items represent the steps taken in the process of
        designing a prototype for a game.

          <h3 class="project__subtitle">The core loop</h3>
          <p class="project__paragraph">
            The player enters a dungeon and kills all the monsters inside each
            room. Killing monsters rewards the player with exp points; Leveling
            up unlocks new attacks and boosts stats. After killing the enemies
            and the boss, the player must find a hidden room behind a false
            wall, which will appear only after the boss is defeated, solve the
            puzzle from the hidden room to gain a cue used to complete the map
            to the Time Capsule, and the dungeon is complete.

          <p class="project__paragraph">
            The player-character and enemies feature a health bar to keep track
            of combat progress. The left joystick is for movement and the right
            one is for aiming and shooting enemies. I thought that implementing
            a roaming glowing pouch which if caught may bring a lot of rare
            items.

            This is a sketch of what the shop/inventory window would look like.
            The player must choose a shield and a weapon to fight with. Each
            item has a name, a rarity level, special stats, and a unique power.

            One of the first scenes that must be created is the tutorial scene,
            which should be kept brief and simple, teaching the player the
            basics of the game, in this case, the tutorial scene is teaching
            players how to move, aim and shoot.

            At first, when designing the map, I was inspired by Ori and the
            Blind Forest, Soul Knight, and Diablo. My vision featured many
            rooms, some hidden ones, and tight corridors. Hidden rooms can be
            found by looking for key items or solving puzzles throughout the
            level.
