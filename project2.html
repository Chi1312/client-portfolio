            I was assigned to work with and lead a team for almost three months
            in order to develop a 3D dungeon crawler called Lost Souls. My role
            for this project was level design. I designed some rooms and was in
            charge of the overall lighting for the project.

          <p class="project__paragraph">
            The first room I created was the Boss room, where the main action
            was supposed to take place. Using Unity Assets, I designed this room
            using props and walls in order to create a dark dungeon feel.

            I thought that shape diversity would be a good idea to keep the
            players interested. Furthermore, the corners of this room turned out
            to be very useful in creating shadows, that would help in hiding
            enemies.

            Adding lights was a real adventure. Finding the right light
            temperature, colour, type, and direction was a long and difficult
            process until I figured it out. For this project, I thought that
            dimmed red candle-like lights would fit our theme the best. The
            action takes place in a post-apocalyptic ancient world, this
            requires a dark, cold atmosphere which I believe was perfectly
            created with the lights settings used.

      <div class="project__content">

          <h3 class="project__subtitle">Boss Room &mdash; Lighting</h3>
          <p class="project__paragraph">
            I chose to add different types of light in the same scene, to
            experiment with the colours and the shadows. The back of the room
            features a wall that goes further back into the room, making placing
            the same lights used for the rest of the room redundant and not
            visible. Therefore, I designed a candle holder that would have more
            small lights all around it. This choice proved to be a good one
            since the scene looks more lively.
