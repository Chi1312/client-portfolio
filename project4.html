          I had the chance to collaborate in a small team to build a single,
          high-quality game. The game was developed within an agile-led
          development structure, drawing on the experience gained in other
          modules to plan and control my progress.

        <p class="project__paragraph">
          I had the opportunity to work with a team in professional conditions.
          We were tasked to design and develop a 2d platformer and provide a
          pitch document, game design document, and promotion and supporting
          plan. My role in this project was that of a level designer. I was
          responsible for designing and creating levels that would fit the theme
          and dynamic of the game.

        <p class="project__paragraph">
          This is the first version of the first level, which is inspired by Ori
          and the Blind Forrest. The first level introduces the players to the
          game mechanics and teaches them how they can be used.

          The most challenging aspect of this process was the sizing of the
          platforms and introducing puzzle areas. A setback that happened during
          this process was that when the assets were chosen for this level, the
          size was not right, meaning the graybox was too small for the assets,
          therefore, I had to re-design the whole level from 0 so that the size
          would be right.

          This first version of the second level was inspired form Ori and the
          Blind Forrest and Celleste. This level features more environmental
          hazards and more synchronized jumps, making the second level more
          challenging than the first one which thought the player how to
          maneuver the game.

          The same story happened with the second-level graybox. The size was
          just not right, therefore, the level had to be re-designed so that the
          assets would be the right size, and the look and feel of the game
          would be improved.
